If you are a fan of FIFA 12 and want to play it on your PC with any gamepad, you might have encountered some difficulties with the default settings. The game does not recognize some gamepads or does not allow you to customize the buttons according to your preferences. Fortunately, there is a solution for this problem: a universal gamepads configuration file created by Obievasquez16.

[**Download File**](https://walllowcopo.blogspot.com/?download=2tLuLS)

 
This file is a compressed archive (.rar) that contains a modified buttonDataSetup.ini file and a x360ce.exe program. The buttonDataSetup.ini file is the one that tells the game how to map the buttons of your gamepad, while the x360ce.exe program is an emulator that makes your gamepad appear as an Xbox 360 controller to the game. By using these two files, you can play FIFA 12 on PC with any gamepad and customize the buttons as you like.
 
Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download the universal gamepads configuration file from [here](https://www.2shared.com/file/Nno1YXuC/FIFA_12_PC_Universal_Gamepads_.html) [^1^].
2. Extract the file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
3. Copy the buttonDataSetup.ini file and paste it in your FIFA 12 installation folder, usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\FIFA 12\Game\fifasetup. Replace the existing file if prompted.
4. Copy the x360ce.exe file and paste it in your FIFA 12 installation folder, usually located at C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\FIFA 12\Game. Do not replace any existing file.
5. Run the x360ce.exe program and follow the instructions on the screen. You might need to create a new profile for your gamepad and adjust the settings according to your preferences. You can also test your gamepad buttons and vibration feedback.
6. Save the settings and close the program.
7. Run FIFA 12 and enjoy playing with your gamepad.

Here are some additional tips and tricks for playing FIFA 12 on PC with any gamepad:

- If you want to change the button layout of your gamepad, you can edit the buttonDataSetup.ini file manually using a text editor like Notepad. You can find the codes for each button in this [guide](https://www.fifa-infinity.com/fifa-12-2/fifa-12-gamepad-fix/) . For example, if you want to swap the A and B buttons, you can change the line BUTTON\_A=0 to BUTTON\_A=1 and the line BUTTON\_B=1 to BUTTON\_B=0.
- If you want to use more than one gamepad for multiplayer mode, you can run the x360ce.exe program multiple times and create a profile for each gamepad. You can also assign different controller IDs to each gamepad using the Advanced tab in the program.
- If you experience any lag or performance issues while playing FIFA 12 with your gamepad, you can try lowering the graphics settings or disabling some features like anti-aliasing or motion blur. You can also update your graphics card drivers or install the latest patches for the game.

That's all for now. I hope you enjoy playing FIFA 12 on PC with any gamepad. If you have any feedback or suggestions for me, please let me know.
